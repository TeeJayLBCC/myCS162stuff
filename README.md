# myCS162stuff
my first ever GitHub repo!

Interesting Topics:
1) best practices for saved passwords / auto sign-in
2) optimizing code to use fewer CPU resources or other performance metrics
3) basic graphics with GIMP
4) AWS or VMWare virtual machines
5) how DOSBOX emulates games I used to play in the '80s


Challenging Topics:
1) learning to use GitHub
2) posting values to a web page from a simple CSV database
3) firewall/ WirelessAccess Point blacklists vs whitelists
4) keeping file I/O data scrubbed & clean to avoid garbage in garbage out
5) partitioning SSD storage for different OS - ChromeOS Flex has been the most challenging
